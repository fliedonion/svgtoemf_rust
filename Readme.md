Inkscape wrapper to convert svg to emf for older MS office.

restriction : 
  Wrapped strings may not be converted correctly.
  The background color of semi-transparent images will be black. This is due to the fact that Inkscape only supports EMF, not EMF+. However, the EMF+ specification seems to be complicated, so we cannot expect it to be supported.
